# Demonstration and Practice

Core Concepts:
 - Style vector elements to enable group selection based on stroke and fill properties within Illustrator
 - Include registration points in the layers to be exported to enable alignment with other layers
 - Export single graphic components as PDF files from the QGIS Layout Tool
 - Open exported PDF file in Illustrator
 - Select features from imported PDF file and copy into new layer in composite Illustrator file

Process

1. Create an empty Illustrator document that the GIS-generated layers will be added to.

If you like you can install the [Brewer color palette](http://mkweb.bcgsc.ca/brewer/) that I will be using. Otherwise you can use whatever colors you like within the existing suite of Illustrator palettes. 

1. Single "layer" styling and transfer

	1. QGIS - demo of raster layer (statewide satellite image) selection and export
	1. QGIS - demo of vector layer (counties) import - basic styling of features - export of PDF version of styled features		
	2. Illustrator - opening of PDF file - copying, pasting and aligning separate feature collections

Repeated process for Tribal Lands, New Mexico interstates, and well locations.

2. Selection and styling of features in Illustrator
		1. 
 
3. Introduction of raster data in the workflow
		1. QGIS - add 2 raster basemaps to vector map, one photo, another derived from digital terrain model (i.e. hillshade for nice cartographic effect with photo) - export PDF
		2. Illustrator - opening of PDF file - demonstrate difference between vector and raster objects in imported PDF file, highlighting difference between types of objects (raster/vector) - copy raster objects from PDF file into new layers in previous PDF that had vector data moved into layers
 
4. Addition of other cartographic elements
		1. QGIS - add feature labels - demonstrate layout mode for adding legend, map scale, north arrow - export PDF
		2. Illustrator - open PDF - modify existing cartographic elements - create new elements based on the elements generated by the GIS - custom feature labels using text tools - highlighting areas of interest - other annotations
