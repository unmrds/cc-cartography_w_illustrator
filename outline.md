# Workshop outline - Cartography and Illustrator 

1. Introduction
2. Conceptual Overview
   1. Objective - production of publication quality graphic products based on geospatial data
   2. Complementary roles of GIS and graphics programs in a production workflow
   3. Shared concepts across applications
      1. Raster/vector
      2. Layers
      3. Objects
      4. Styling
      5. Layout
   4. Exchange of content between applications using the shared PDF 
   5. Other approaches
      1. Direct map production in Illustrator
         1. Based on available vector boundaries
         2. ArcGIS integration with Illustrator
         3. [Avenza](https://www.avenza.com) Map Publisher
      2. Basic styling and layout in GIS application
3. Demonstration / Practice (possibly Big-I and UNM campus area, though an area with more relief would be nice for demonstrating hillshade effect)
   1. Single "layer" styling and transfer
      1. QGIS - demo of vector layer (transportation) import - basic styling of features - export of PDF version of styled features
      2. Illustrator - opening of PDF file - exploring and selecting (by shared appearance) features - grouping features - styling grouped features
   2. Multiple layer interaction
      1. QGIS - addition of multiple vector layers - change visibility - ordering and influence on visibility - styling multiple layers - export PDF
      2. Illustrator - opening of PDF file - selecting similar features and moving into separate layers - changing order and visibility of layers - selecting all features in a layer for styling - additional styling practice
   3. Introduction of raster data in the workflow
      1. QGIS - add 2 raster basemaps to vector map, one photo, another derived from digital terrain model (i.e. hillshade for nice cartographic effect with photo) - export PDF
      2. Illustrator - opening of PDF file - demonstrate difference between vector and raster objects in imported PDF file, highlighting difference between types of objects (raster/vector) - copy raster objects from PDF file into new layers in previous PDF that had vector data moved into layers
   4. Addition of other cartographic elements
      1. QGIS - add feature labels - demonstrate layout mode for adding legend, map scale, north arrow - export PDF
      2. Illustrator - open PDF - modify existing cartographic elements - create new elements based on the elements generated by the GIS - custom feature labels using text tools - highlighting areas of interest - other annotations
